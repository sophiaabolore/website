"Sadness is a normal emotion that is triggered by a specific   adverse event or bad experience. In other words, we become sad about something specific. This emotional state dissipates after some time or after something good, replaces the hurtful event that triggered the initial sadness. Sadness is temporary. . ."

"Being sad from time to time serves some kind of purpose in helping our species to survive. Yet, while other so-called "negative emotions," like fear, anger, and disgust, seem clearly adaptive-preparing our species for flight, fight, or avoidance, respectively-the evolutionary benefits of sadness have been harder to understand. . . until recently, that is.

With the advent of fMRI imaging and the proliferation of brain research, scientists have begun to find out more about how sadness works in the brain and influences our thoughts and behavior. Though happiness is still desirable in many situations, there are others in which a mild sad mood confers important advantages."

"A negative emotion may even help you. Our world focuses on happiness and treats unhappiness as an unnecessary or useless feeling. But sadness can slow you down, and make you really think about your life, your feelings and the people around you. It can help you keep sight of your relationships and dreams. In other words, being sad doesn’t mean you are not coping with a situation. Rather, it helps you come to terms with that situation and move on. It is an important emotion that can help you adapt, accept, focus, persevere and grow."

"When a person is feeling down, they found, the communication increased between brain cells in two specific regions of the brain involved in memory and emotion.

It's unclear whether this increased brain communication is a cause or an effect of a bad mood, the researchers noted"

"MRI scans have shown that people who have recently been dumped have higher than normal activity in the region of the brain that registers physical pain. 

This triggers the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, leading to all kinds of physical symptoms, such as nausea, difficulty breathing, and also a weakening of the heart muscle that doctors call Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."

                                 <li>Listen to some positive upbeat music.</li>
"A 2013 study in the Journal of Positive Psychology found that people who listened to upbeat music could improve their moods and boost their happiness in just two weeks. In the study, participants were instructed to try to improve their mood, but they only succeeded when they listened to the upbeat music of Copland as opposed to the sadder tunes of Stravinsky. And a happier mood brings benefits beyond feeling good. In a press release, lead study author, Yuna Ferguson, noted that happiness has been linked to better physical health, higher income, and greater relationship satisfaction."

                                 <li>Change your scenery</li>
"While the concept of biophilia is debatable, the effects of the phenomenon are not; researchers noted that simply staring at an image of natural scenery for 40 seconds was enough to trigger the brain into a more relaxed state. The control group in this study stared at a concrete roof, while the test subjects stared at a green meadow."

"Social media use can also promote loneliness and isolation, according to a 2017 review by Duke University.3 We often use sites like Facebook for "social snacking", which gives the illusion of connection, but does not fulfil us in the same way as real life social interactions."

"Self-compassion is associated with better moods and positive characteristics, according to a 2007 study published in the Journal of Research in Personality. Researchers concluded that self-compassion was linked to happiness, optimism, wisdom, personal initiative, and curiosity."

"Women who described their homes as "cluttered" or full of "unfinished projects" were more fatigued, and had higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol than women who felt their homes were "restful" and "restorative," according to a study in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin."

"[Exercise] promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that energize your spirits and make you feel good."
