Upside was founded by Sophia Abolore after she experienced a lot of anxiousness

during the start of her last year of highschool. This resulted in her second 

guessing all her decisions, misinterpreting her friends attitudes towards her 

and her self esteem plumeting.This all changed afer Sophia began to research why 

exactly she felt this way, she grew to understand the root causes of her problems,

how they affected her mind and way of thinking and how she could combat these 

emotions. Sophia saw noticed a drastic change in her daily mood, resilience and 

her happiness. 

In order to help other teenagers understand their emotions, she decided to invite 

her friends from her school's peer support club to help with the research and use 

her programming background to create a website with information of the most common 

emotions experienced by teenagers.

Upside strives to help you understand your emotions and the effect they have on 

you by providing a list of emotions commonly felt by teens and in dept information 

on those emotions. Upside also provides methods to deal with or relieve those emotions

 as well as providing sources that attest to the effectiveness of those methods so you 

can read further into them. If a method speaks to you, you can try it out and if it

works you can add it to your mood boosters list and give it a rating from 1 to 10, that 

way whenever you feel that emotion you’ll know what to do. You can also take a quiz to 

see your resilience level and compare it to your past selves’.
