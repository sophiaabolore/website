"Anxiety is a feeling of unease, worry or fear. Everyone feels anxious at some point in their life, but for some people it can be an ongoing problem. A little bit of anxiety can be helpful; for example, feeling anxious before an exam might make you more alert and improve your performance. But too much anxiety could make you tired and unable to concentrate."

"With anxiety you get the same response [fear] but your threat is for example, [anything that negatively impacts you]... Your brain finds it hard to return to normal, as you keep the response going by continually thinking and worrying about it... Your brain has mistakenly identified something as a 'threat.'  So you are getting the correct response if something is a threat, but the 'threat' has been identified incorrectly in your brain."

An example with Dr. Ryan's idea could include being worried about a test vs. being so nervous to take it that you skip taking it or cry about it. Feeling anxious about a test could also increase how much you procrastinate. You don't want to study because studying makes you think more about the test which makes you more worried, so to stop that worry you procrastinate more but that's makes you even more worried for the test if you don't or do study.

"A mental toll takes a physical toll, just as anxiety can have an effect on your body. You can feel more jittery, your heart starts pounding more, you have a loss of appetite (or eat more), you need to use the bathroom frequently, and your breath becomes shorter. Feeling anxious can also make you more irritable(which makes you lash out more), not being able to relax, and having sleeping difficulties (can't sleep regularly, enough, or too much)"

"A little anxiety is fine, but long-term anxiety may cause more serious health problems, such as high blood pressure (hypertension). You may also be more likely to develop infections. If you're feeling anxious all the time, or it's affecting your day-to-day life, you may have an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder."

<h4>Make subtle changes</h4>
Some less noticeable ways to decrease anxiousness include:

<li>Stand/sit up straight</li>
<li>Try to stay in the present, not the past or the future</li>
<li>Do something easy you know you can finish (Throwing out the trash, taking a bath) to stop feeling like you can’t do anything when you’re anxious</li>
