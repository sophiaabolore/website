"The emotion of envy is often confused with jealousy. Envy is directed at another or others, wanting their qualities, success, or possession. Jealousy involves thinking you will lose, or have lost, some affection or security from another person because of someone or something else-including their interest in an activity that takes time away from you."

"Envy refers to the often-painful emotion caused by an awareness of an advantage enjoyed by another person. It is a complex, socially repugnant emotion made up of a mix of inferiority feelings, hostility, and resentment. Envy is different from admiration, which is delight and approval inspired by another person. Admiration can foster a desire to emulate another person's success, whereas envy breeds a competitive desire to outdo and even bring the envied person down in some cases."

"Despite its reputation as being distasteful, tacky, petty, and downright gauche, it is likely that envy hasplayed an important role in humans' quest for the resources necessary for successful survival and reproduction over the course of evolutionary time"

" "Malicious envy felt much more frustrating, the experience led to a motivation to hurt the other, and one hoped that the other would fail in something,"van de Ven wrote. "For benign envy, the other was liked more, the situation was more inspiring, and one tried harder to attain more for oneself" "

"Benign envy can sound a lot like admiration. The difference is that, while admiration feels good, envy is painful. By way of illustration, van de Ven cites the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard, who wrote that, while "admiration is happy self-surrender," "envy is unhappy self-assertion." Admiration can be a pleasant feeling, in large part because we think of the people we admire as being unlike ourselves. But people we benignly envy seem to be a lot like us. That realization hits closer to home-and hurts.
<p> </p>
The differences between benign and malicious envy, meanwhile, are stark: the two spur us to act in very different ways. In a followup, van de Ven asked his subjects, every evening for two weeks, whether they'd experienced envy that day; if they had, he probed the specific contours of the emotion and asked them to report how it had made them act. He found that the more closely their feelings aligned with malicious envy the more they complained about the person they envied. (They didn't do anything about it; they were just nasty.) By contrast, if they felt benign envy they worked harder. Benign envy may be unpleasant, but it's a driver of change for the better."

"Envy is hypothesized to have been shaped by selection to facilitate successful social competition for access to resources that affect fitness. A central component of successful resource competition is rendering oneself more deservingof the resources one is competing for relative to others who are striving to achieve the same goal"

"A clear correlation emerged between lowered self-esteem and increased jealousy, which was particularly marked in women, for whom robust self-esteem was virtually incompatible with high jealousy concerns. "

                                 <li>Think about why you're jealous</li>
"When you notice that you are feeling jealous, take a moment, breathe slowly, and observe your thoughts and feelings. Recognize that jealous thoughts are not the same thing as a REALITY. You may think that your partner is interested in someone else, but that doesn't mean that he really is. Thinking and reality are different."

                                 <li>Focus on yourself </li>
"The best thing we can do is focus on feeling strong and secure in ourselves. We have to do the work to conquer our inner critic and believe that we are okay, even on our own. We don't need one specific person's love to believe we're loveable. Human beings are full of flaws and limitations, and no one can give us what we need 100 percent of the time. This is why it's so important to practice self-compassion and learn to stand up to our own inner critic."

"When something like jealousy is taking over, it's important to find the right person to talk to and a healthy way to express what we feel. The people who support a positive side of us and who help stop us from ruminating or sinking deeper into our sorrows are the kind of friends we want to talk to about our jealousy."

                                 <li>Remember social media doesn't reflection reality</li>
"Online profiles allow for people to manipulate their online appearance, and onlookers tend to believe in the fantasy of this online life. You have only to look at the difference between how recipes look on Pinterest versus real life to recognize this perception problem. But it's a lot harder to apply this logic to the feelings stemming from looking at a partner's Facebook or Instagram profile."

                                 <li>Turn your envy into gratitude</li>
" Gratitude is not about ignoring what we desire, but choosing to focus on the things we do have that bring us value or joy. Focusing on your appreciation for knowing the value of a dollar or your work ethic when you're envious of a friend's financial situation can make conversations much less triggering. Instead of feeling envious of a friend's appearance, focus on the things you like about yourself, or the fact that you have a body that allows you to exercise."

"Part of the reason why envy can be so destructive is because of the unrealistic ideas we hold. That's why it helps to aim for a more realistic understanding of, and approach to, envy itself. Online, and even in the context of our closest relationships, there is little discussion of life's difficult and darker moments...We tend to showcase and discuss the highlights of our lives, while omitting the low or even mundane points. Gently remind yourself that, although not always distributed evenly, everyone faces struggles and hardship. And there might be aspects of your own life that your friends envy greatly."
