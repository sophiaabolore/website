"People have struggled with habitual hesitation going back to ancient civilizations. The Greek poet Hesiod, writing around 800 B.C., cautioned not to "put your work off till tomorrow and the day after." The Roman consul Cicero called procrastination "hateful" in the conduct of affairs. (He was looking at you, Marcus Antonius.) And those are just examples from recorded history. For all we know, the dinosaurs saw the meteorite coming and went back to their game of Angry Pterodactyls."

"Everyone puts things off sometimes, but procrastinators chronically avoid difficult tasks and may deliberately look for distractions. Procrastination in large part reflects struggles with self-control as well as the general human inability to accurately predict how we will feel tomorrow, or the day after."

"Unfortunately, this procrastination can have a serious impact on a number of life areas, including a person's mental health. In a 2007 study, researchers found that at the beginning of the semester, students who were procrastinators reported less illness and lower stress levels than non-procrastinators. This changed dramatically by the end of the term when procrastinators reported higher levels of stress and illness.

Not only can procrastination have a negative impact on your health; it can also harm your social relationships. By putting things off, you are placing a burden on the people around you. If you habitually turn in projects late or dawdle until the last minute, the people who depend on you such as your friends, family, co-workers, and fellow students can become resentful."

"Dr. Heath believes that procrastination is actually a defense mechanism. "Your unconscious mind thinks it is helping you. But it is misguided. So the procrastinator's mind uses a defense mechanism-repression-to kind of forget about the task. 'Oh, there are so many other things I need to do.' And the procrastinator usually minimizes the amount of time the task will take. This, of course, is the trick our mind plays with us. It hopes the task will go away." "

"this most recent study...have now linked this inability to control action to anatomical differences in the brain as well as functional connections between brain regions.
They found a relation between the gray matter volume of the amygdala and difficulties in initiating action (theoretically this is known as decision-related action orientation).

...the researchers also explored how this neuroautomical hub was connected to other brain regions. The question here was focused on functional connectivity rather than anatomical size. Here, the researchers again found a unique difference related to the amygdala between those with action control difficulties and those who do not have trouble initiating behaviors. Specifically, interindividual differences related to action control were related to differences in resting-state connectivity between the amygdala and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)-a region of the brain that is known for the top-down regulation of the amygdala and various facets of self-control."

"In a 2013 study, Dr. Pychyl and Dr. Sirois found that procrastination can be understood as “the primacy of short-term mood repair . . .over the longer-term pursuit of intended actions." Put simply, procrastination is about being more focused on "the immediate urgency of managing negative moods" than getting on with the task, Dr. Sirois said.

The particular nature of our aversion depends on the given task or situation. It may be due to something inherently unpleasant about the task itself - having to clean a dirty bathroom or organizing a long, boring spreadsheet for your boss. But it might also result from deeper feelings related to the task, such as self-doubt, low self-esteem, anxiety or insecurity."

"There's an entire body of research dedicated to the ruminative, self-blaming thoughts many of us tend to have in the wake of procrastination, which are known as "procrastinatory cognitions." The thoughts we have about procrastination typically exacerbate our distress and stress, which contribute to further procrastination"

"This annoying tendency actually has some evolutionary significance. Humans are wired to consider the needs of the present much more strongly than the needs of the future, a phenomenon called temporal discounting.
And this makes perfect sense: The present is in our face, so naturally we pay it more attention."

"Perfectionism and procrastination are linked, but it's not necessarily the sky-high standards that slow you down, but the sky-high standards mixed with a belief that your performance is tied to your self-worth. That combination can grind you to a halt.

Always remember the crucial difference between who you are and what you achieve. There's so much more to your worth than your accomplishments-your identity, family, passions, experiences, travels, friends, politics, taste, knowledge, challenges you've overcome, and, most importantly, how you treat other people."

                                 <li>Reward Yourself</li>
"As you complete each of these smaller steps, the sense of satisfaction and accomplishment you feel can be its own reward and can create its own motivation to move on to the next step. However, sometimes you can benefit from an extra reward. In these cases, you can propel yourself forward by attaching small rewards to each of your small steps, or a bigger reward when you complete several. Go to a movie, celebrate milestones with friends, do things you enjoy when you complete your tasks. You may be dreading the task itself, but the treat on the other side can motivate you to get started!"

                                 <li>Start with Easier tasks </li>
"When a task feels overwhelming, it's often because we doubt our ability to tackle it. One way to build self-confidence is to tackle the easier parts of the job first.
Once the easy parts of the job are completed, you'll be left with less overall work to do, so the rest of the job is smaller and may seem easier to take on. In both ways, your confidence can grow by taking on the easy parts of the job first

<dd>Distribute the small steps reasonably within the given time frame. "Reasonably" is the key word; you must allot sufficient time for each step. Do not fool yourself by believing you can do more than is humanly possible.</dd>

<dd>Realize that humans periodically need variety and relaxation. Intersperse rewards, relaxation, and gratification for work completed. This will help you feel less resentful of the task and the work that still needs to be done.</dd>

<dd>Monitor your progress on the small steps. Watch for the pitfalls discussed earlier. Assess problems when they arise and do something about them quickly. Keep track of the segments and how they fit together to form the whole picture. Reassess time commitments as necessary.</dd>

<dd>Be reasonable in your expectations of yourself. Perfectionistic or extremely strict expectations may cause you to rebel or may sabotage your progress."</dd>
