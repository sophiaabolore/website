"Anger is one of the basic human emotions, as elemental as happiness, sadness, anxiety, or disgust. These emotions are tied to basic survival and were honed over the course of human history. Anger is related to the "fight, flight, or freeze" response of the sympathetic nervous system; it prepares humans to fight. . . ."

"What many people don't realize is that anger is a secondary emotion. What does this mean?  Typically, one of the primary emotions, like fear or sadness, can be found underneath the anger."

"The so-called affective neurosciences have shown the phylogenetic origin of the two circuits underlying the emergence of anger along with its evolutionary role for promoting survival. This view has been integrated by the psychodynamic theory of motivational systems that attribute a double role to anger: on the one hand, this affect works as an inwardly directed signal concerning a pressure to overcome an obstacle or an aversive situation; on the other hand, anger is also an outwardly directed communicative signal establishing differentiation and conflict within interpersonal relationships and affective bonds."

"As you become angry your body's muscles tense up. Inside your brain, neurotransmitter chemicals known as catecholamines are released causing you to experience a burst of energy lasting up to several minutes. This burst of energy is behind the common angry desire to take immediate protective action. At the same time your heart rate accelerates, your blood pressure rises, and your rate of breathing increases. Your face may flush as increased blood flow enters your limbs and extremities in preparation for physical action. Your attention narrows and becomes locked onto the target of your anger. Soon you can pay attention to nothing else. In quick succession, additional brain neurotransmitters and hormones (among them adrenaline and noradrenaline) are released which trigger a lasting state of arousal. You're now ready to fight"

"Reactive aggression is triggered by a frustrating or threatening event and involves unplanned, enraged attacks on the object perceived to be the source of the threat/ frustration. The aggression is often accompanied by anger and can be considered "hot". It is initiated without regard for any potential goal.
Reactive aggression appears to be exhibited by all mammalian species. It is part of the mammalian gradated response to threat. Low levels of danger from distant threats induce freezing. Higher levels of danger from closer threats induce attempts to escape the immediate environment. Higher levels of danger still, when the threat is very close and escape is impossible, initiate reactive aggression."

"There are four basic ways in which people respond to anger:
<li>Aggressive</li>
Anger is externalized, "turned loose".

<li>Passive/Aggressive</li>
Outwardly agreeable, but showing the anger through indirect actions or sabotage.

<li>Passive</li>
Anger is internalized or "locked up".

<li>Assertive</li>
Anger is appropriately managed and communicated if necessary."

"You can write things in lots of ways; for example, in a journal or as your own poetry or song lyrics. After you've written it down, you can keep it or throw it away...it doesn't matter. The important thing is, writing down your thoughts and feelings can improve how you feel. When you notice, label, and release feelings as they show up in smaller portions, they don't have a chance to build up inside."

                                 <li>Talk to someone</li>
"If there's someone who has a calming effect on you, talking through an issue or expressing your feelings to that person may be helpful.It's important to note, however, that venting can backfire. Complaining about your boss, describing all the reasons you don't like someone or grumbling about all of your perceived injustices may add fuel to the fire. A common misconception is that you have to vent your anger to feel better. But, studies show you don't need to "get your anger out". Smashing things when you're upset, for example, may actually make you angrier. So it's important to use this coping skill with caution. If you're going to talk to a friend, make sure you're working on developing a solution or reducing your anger, not just venting."

"

If you've gotten into the habit of losing your temper, it can be helpful to take stock of the things that trigger your anger. Long lines, traffic jams, snarky comments from a friend, or being overtired are just a few things that might shorten your fuse.


That's not to say you should blame people or external circumstances for your inability to keep your cool. But, understanding the things that trigger your anger can help you plan accordingly.


You might decide to structure your day differently to help you manage your stress better. Or, you might practice some anger management techniques before you encounter circumstances that you usually find distressing so you can lengthen your fuse...meaning that a single frustrating episode won't set you off.
